    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>The Flood Forecasting Centre (FFC) and the Scottish Environment
    Protection Agency (SEPA) are interested in verifying high resolution
    ensemble forecasts against rainfall radar and rain gauges for a number
    of river catchments across England, Wales and Scotland.</p>
    <p>There are 898 defined catchments for FFC and 225 for SEPA. The
    rain gauge and radar observations are gridded.</p>

    <div id="ffc-catchments"></div>

    <h2>Existing solution</h2>
    <p>A script has been written by Gabriella Csima which uses iris Cube
    structures to compute catchment means for radar and ensemble forecast precipitation
    accumulations.</p>

    <h2>Performance issues (memory/computation)</h2>
    <p>The cube architecture while it has many benefits such as multiple file
    format support, coordinate transformations and masking catchment shapes. In
    this use case it is unfeasible to load all data into cubes. It would be more
    efficient in both memory and computations to work out which grid cells
    relate to each catchment and to iteratively compute averages.</p>

    <h2>User interface</h2>
    <p>At present, the user interface requires 7 arguments, two of which
    are namelist files who themselves contain a list of arguments. While
    practical for getting the script developed there is plenty of scope
    for improvement.</p>

    </pre>

    <p>The first namelist contains the following settings</p>
    <pre>

    fullcats

    96
    /data/users/frrn/ffc/

    </pre>

    <p>The second namelist contains the following settings</p>
    <pre>
    Y
    0, 50, 100, 150
    </pre>

    <p>The two namelist settings could easily be rolled into the command
    line interface. And the number of arguments can be reduced by choosing
    sensible defaults.</p>

    <h2>Conclusions</h2>
    <p>With a little bit of thought and some refactoring
    this script could become a nice lightweight utility for
    verifying river catchments</p>
