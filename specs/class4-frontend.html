    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The existing front-end for Class 4 statistics is not scalable.</p>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Exploring ocean verification results at present requires the user to
    repeatedly generate static images from NetCDF files.
    To isolate a particular issue, the user must iteratively re-run c4plot
    using more and more precise command line arguments to bisect the affected
    dates.</p>
    <p>A more desirable solution would be for the user to click/zoom to the
    affected portion of the time series without having to re-generate images. Indeed,
    the user should not even need access to the underlying files to be able to
    explore the data.</p>
    <p>The present system serves two uses. It is both a monitoring tool and a tool to track
    our performance relative to other forecasting centers. However, since it
    can only generate static images it cannot simultaneously display both
    a high-level and low-level view of the data. The proposed solution aims to
    unify these use cases by providing the user with an interface adapted for
    both diagnosis and long term summarisation.</p>
    <h2>Issues</h2>
    <p>As requests for more detailed plot types and metrics are made to the
    existing front-end, there is a combinatorial explosion of plots.</p>
    <h3>Labour intensive data exploration</h3>
    <h3>Combinatorial explosion of plots</h3>
    <h3>User driven plotting</h3>
    <p>More and more, users of the data are requesting that plots be generated
    in a bespoke manner. Individually, these requests seem sensible. But
    aggregated over half a dozen users it becomes difficult to service their
    requests. A tool is needed to generate bespoke plots on a per-user basis
    without a need for manual intervention from the site-owner.</p>
    <h2>Proposal</h2>
    <p>The replacement tool should make it easier to diagnose issues
    affecting one or more ocean model</p>
        <h3>Features</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Add/remove individual lines</li>
            <li>Pan/zoom to spike of interest</li>
            <li>Reveal using tooltips the values of particular data points</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Dependencies</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>d3.js</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The only hard dependency of this proposed tool is to leverage
        a JavaScript library called d3.js to do the heavy lifting when it
        comes to svg element rendering.</p>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>The existing solution while functional it is not scalable</p>
